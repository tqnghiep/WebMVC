Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC 4
	1. Adding a Controller:
		- http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/adding-a-controller
		-
		Note:
			- ASP.NET MVC invokes different controller classes (and different action methods within them) depending on the incoming URL. The default URL routing logic used by ASP.NET MVC uses a format like this to determine what code to invoke:
			/[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]
			- The first part of the URL determines the controller class to execute. So /HelloWorld maps to the HelloWorldController class. The second part of the URL determines the action method on the class to execute. So /HelloWorld/Index would cause the Index method of the HelloWorldController class to execute. Notice that we only had to browse to /HelloWorld and the Index method was used by default. This is because a method named Index is the default method that will be called on a controller if one is not explicitly specified.
			- Browse to http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/Welcome. The Welcome method runs and returns the string "This is the Welcome action method...". The default MVC mapping is /[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]. For this URL, the controller is HelloWorld and Welcome is the action method. You haven't used the [Parameters] part of the URL yet.
		Ex: 
			- Add 1 Controller Category within the name is CategoryController
			- Write more 1 action/method/view-function inside controller "List"
			- Parameters: add params like ID, Code, etc..
			=> link view list products of the category like: /Category/List/ID=10
	2. Adding a View:

		-
		Note: 
			- View level is inside controller class. That is all actions/methods/view-functions with arguments.
			- View folder of the project is template or we can understand like that.
			
		How-know: We have something like Controller => View => Template. 
				It's mean 1 request be called, it take on Controller and then, controller call the action/method/view-function of process. when processed, it render and asign data for template to display
	3. Adding a Model:
		- http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/adding-a-model
		- 
		Note: This level working with database and provider data for controller
		
	4. Accessing Your Model's Data from a Controller:
